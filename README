This is a small project demonstrating some simple tweaks of Android Preferences you may find useful.

In particular:

* add a "Reset to Default" button that appears next to widget in Preference screen if value is different from default; 
implemented for checkbox, seekbar, (tweaked) color picker, and text preference
* add "Reset all Preferences to Default" functionality
* tweaks on color picker from Android graphics demo
